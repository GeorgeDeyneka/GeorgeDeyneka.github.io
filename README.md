## About project

This is my pet project, written during the training course from HYS Enterprise. It is an online store where you can view products, add them to your cart, and create an order.

However, if you have administrator rights and are logged in, you can filter or sort products, users, and orders using the filter bar. You also have the ability to interact with the server and perform CRUD operations.

Future plans include developing my own API and adding the ability to upload images, as well as adding more detailed product information.

First of all, when you go from the start page by clicking the "Go Shopping!" you are taken to the main page. This is a product catalog. By clicking on the "Load More" button, you can additionally load products.

By clicking on the "Add to Cart" buttons, you can add products to the cart and see in the modal window (you can hover over the "Cart" link at the top of the page). Clicking on the link will redirect you to the shopping cart page.
